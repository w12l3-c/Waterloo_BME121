# Waterloo BME 
Created by Wallace

These are all the C++ projects and assignments done in the 1A term of BME using VSCode <br>
This will be continually update throughout the entire 1st year

## Assignments
1. Basic Programming
  - Basic terminal command for compiling and executing c++ files
  - Basic usage of IOStream
  - Basic mathematics and logical operations
2. Math and Case Study
  - Case study of math related diagnosis
  - Using more variations of mathematics and logical operations
  - Array Manipulation
3. Problems Solving
  - Using String manipulation to draw patterns and rewrite sentences
  - Implmenting Summing function to exceed the limit of INT_MAX and INT_MIN
  - Implementing Bubble Sort to structralize a small dataset of a psuedo clinic patients' information
4. Ultrasound Imaging A-mode
  - Process and analyze data collected from ultrasound beamformer 
  - Using Modular Programming of creating a library and coding its functions
  - Reading Data from collected CSV files
  - This includes Preprocessing and using linear algebra to extract the features in the real and imaginary data
  - Afterwards it will generate a CSV file and by graphing it on execl will reveal the visible spikes that represends the detected artery
5. Ultrasound Imaging Advance B-mode
  - Collecting ultrasound data in a 3 Dimensional manner from ultrasound beamformer
  - Using OOP techniques and data structures such as linked-lists to keep track and iterate each beamline's information
  - Use Linear Algebra and Multi-Dimensional Arrays to hold and process a much larger set of real and imaginary data
  - More Complex Modular Programming and Multi-File Handling
  - Use OpenGL to generate the image of ultrasound on arteries based on the scanline information 
  
## Practices
- MergeSort
- Queues & Stacks
- Overloading Functions and Operators (including class methods, contructors and decontructors)
- Recusion
- Multi-File Manipulation
- Custom Data-Type
